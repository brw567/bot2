# Ultimate Crypto Scalping Bot

## Project Summary
The Ultimate Crypto Scalping Bot is an advanced trading tool designed for high-frequency scalping in cryptocurrency markets, focusing on small price movements for quick profits. It integrates real-time data analysis (technical indicators, sentiment, on-chain metrics), AI-driven decisions (Grok for risk/tuning), machine learning predictions (LSTM), and automated executions on Binance (spot/futures). Key features include modular strategies (arbitrage, grid, MEV detection), risk management (dynamic SL/TP, Kelly sizing), backtesting (vectorbt/backtrader), and a Streamlit GUI with Telegram notifications.

### Pros
- High-frequency scalping with >60% winrate target.
- AI/ML enhanced signals for accuracy (~15% boost in sims).
- Risk controls (drawdown pauses, quotas) for capital preservation.
- User-friendly GUI and mobile alerts.
- Backup price fetch from Grok when Binance fails (UI shows yellow highlight).
- AnalyticsEngine falls back to Grok for OHLCV if Binance errors (row highlighted in yellow).
- Telegram alerts on strategy switches and critical errors (set TELEGRAM_* keys in .env).
- Dashboard shows per-pair Sharpe ratio computed by the AnalyticsEngine.
- Grok recommends additional pairs, monitoring 5x the configured amount for analytics.
- Market volatility indicator with automatic pair swapping based on configurable thresholds.
- Async AnalyticsEngine monitors multiple pairs and suggests strategy switches.
- Per-pair settings with DB persistence and AgGrid editing.
- Metrics table highlights Grok-sourced rows in yellow and shows real-time switch alerts.
- Interactive charts and sidebar controls remain visible on all pages.
- Unit tests via `pytest` ensure core logic like volatility scaling works.
- Full error logs written to `bot.log` with Telegram alerts for critical failures.

### Cons
- Dependency on APIs (Binance, Grok, Dune, Telegram)â€”downtime risks.
- Requires setup (API keys, Telethon session).
- Crypto volatility/fees may erode profits.

### High-Level Architecture (HLA)
- **Data Layer**: WebSocket (Binance), on-chain (Dune), Telegram channels.
- **Analysis Layer**: TA-Lib indicators, LSTM ML, Grok AI, signal aggregation.
- **Strategy Layer**: BaseStrategy with arbitrage, grid, MEV.
- **Execution Layer**: CCXT trades, async monitoring.
- **UI/Control Layer**: Streamlit GUI, Telegram bots.
- **Persistence**: SQLite (params/trades), HDF5 (historical), Redis (pub/sub and message cache).

### On-Chain Metrics from Dune
Metric Name | Type | Description and Use
----------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------
volume | float | Trading volume for spike check ( >2.0 for breakout pattern in `detect_pattern`).
whale_transfers | int | Large transfers count for reversal detection ( >1000000 for 'reversal' pattern).
gas_fee | int | Current gas fee in gwei for arb cost ( <50 for buy in `generate_signal`).
price_diff | float | DEX vs CEX price difference for arb opportunity ( >0.001 and positive sentiment for 'buy').
mempool_density | float | Pending tx density for sandwich risk ( >0.8 for 'hold' in `is_sandwich_risk`).
gas_history | list | Gas fee history for volatility std ( <0.1 for safe arb in `detect_pattern`).

The bot queries these metrics via a single Dune API call. The query accepts a
`symbol` parameter and supports BTC, ETH, and SOL to fetch data for the
corresponding chains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana).

### Low-Level Architecture (LLA)
- Utils: binance/ccxt/grok/ml/onchain/telegram_utils.py.
- Strategies: base/arbitrage/grid/mev_strategy.py.
- Core: scalping_bot.py (async loop, GUI), backtest.py, cleanup_hdf5.py.
- Config: config.py (.env loading).

### Documentation Structure
- [User_Guide.md](docs/User_Guide.md): Setup, usage, GUI.
- [Developer_Guide.md](docs/Developer_Guide.md): Code structure, contribution, testing.
- [Ops Guide.md](docs/Ops%20Guide.md): Deployment, monitoring, maintenance.
- [Install Guide.md](docs/Install%20Guide.md): Revised setup with Telethon init.

### Setup
Run `./install.sh` to initialize. See Install Guide.md for details.
Create a `.env` with Binance, Grok and Telegram keys. All keys are validated on
startup so missing values raise a clear error and prevent accidental key leaks.
Telegram credentials enable real-time switch alerts when the AnalyticsEngine changes strategies.

### Contribution
Fork repo, create feature branch, PR with tests.
